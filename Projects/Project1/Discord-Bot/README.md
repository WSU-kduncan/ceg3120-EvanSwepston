# Setup
- After going to discord's developer portal and creating a new application, you can then create a bot. Below the bot's username is an API token that can be copied and used, or regenerated if necessary.
- The token must be put in a file named `.env`
- To run, you need to install python3, pip, discord.py, and python-dotenv

# Usage
- If you type the command `Chidi` into chat, the bot will respond with a random quote from The Good Place

# Research
- To keep the discord bot working 24/7, you could set it up on a raspberry pi that is constantly plugged in and running.As long as your power doesn't go out the bot will be able to work.
